Explanation of `setup_apache_ssl.sh` Script

The `setup_apache_ssl.sh` script shown below demonstrates the process of simulating the setup of Apache SSL in a Unix/Linux environment:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Simulating Apache SSL setup..."
sleep 1
echo "Apache SSL setup completed and server restarted"

Code Explanation:

1. `#!/bin/bash`:

This command tells the computer to use the Bash shell to run the script. It is known as a shebang and is used at the beginning of shell scripts to specify the interpreter.

2. `echo "Simulating Apache SSL setup..."`:

The `echo` command prints the specified text ("Simulating Apache SSL setup...") to the terminal. This line indicates that the script is starting the simulation of the Apache SSL setup process.

3. `sleep 1`:

The `sleep` command pauses the execution of the script for 1 second. This command imitates a brief delay, simulating the time it might take to set up Apache SSL.

4. `echo "Apache SSL setup completed and server restarted"`:

This is another `echo` command that confirms the successful simulation of the Apache SSL setup. It informs the user that the setup has been completed and the server has been restarted.

In summary, the `setup_apache_ssl.sh` script simulates the process of setting up Apache SSL by printing messages to indicate the start and completion of the process, with a brief pause in between to mimic the setup time.
