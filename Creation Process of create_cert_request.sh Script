Step-by-Step Guide for create_cert_request.sh:

Script Introduction:

The create_cert_request.sh script is designed to simulate the creation of a certificate request in a Unix/Linux environment. It demonstrates fundamental shell scripting techniques and is versatile for generating 
certificate requests (*.csr files) to meet various security and authentication needs.The script provides a straightforward approach to generating certificate requests (*.csr files) and serves as a foundation for 
handling SSL/TLS certificate management tasks.

Steps to Create and Execute `create_cert_request.sh`

1. Open Git Bash: Launch Git Bash on your computer.

2. Navigate to the Directory (Optional):
If we don't have a specific directory yet, we can create one to organize our `scripts`. For example, to create a new directory named scripts, we would use:

mkdir scripts

Then, navigate into this directory using:

cd scripts

3. Create the Script File: Use `nano` or another text editor in Git Bash to create and edit the `create_cert_request.sh` script file:

nano create_cert_request.sh

4. Enter Script Content: Paste the script content for `create_cert_request.sh`:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Creating certificate request..."
sleep 1
echo "Certificate request created and saved to cert_request.csr"

5. Save and Exit: Save the file in `nano` by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then exit with `Ctrl + X`.

6. Make Script Executable: Change the script file's permissions to make it executable:

chmod +x create_cert_request.sh

7. Run the Script: Execute the script to simulate creating a certificate request:

./create_cert_request.sh

Sample Output:
I have included the output of running create_cert_request.sh below. This script simulates the creation of a certificate request and saves it to cert_request.csr.

Creating certificate request...
Certificate request created and saved to cert_request.csr

This output demonstrates the successful execution of the script and the expected result.

Output Attachment:
The output from create_cert_request.sh has been included in the README.md file for reference.

Script Summary:
These steps will help us create and test the create_cert_request.sh script file. Just like with the create_rsa_key.sh script, this script simulates the creation of a certificate request and provides feedback on the process.
