Step-by-Step Guide for `create_certificate_authority.sh` Script:

Script Introduction:

The `create_certificate_authority.sh` script simulates the process of creating a Certificate Authority (CA) and generating a CA certificate in a Unix/Linux environment. It provides a simplified demonstration of setting up a CA, which is essential for managing and 
issuing digital certificates within an organization's infrastructure.

Steps to Create and Execute `create_certificate_authority.sh`:

1. Open Git Bash: Launch Git Bash on your computer.

2. Navigate to the Directory (Optional):

If we don't have a specific directory yet, we can create one to organize our scripts. For example, create a new directory named `scripts`:

mkdir scripts
cd scripts

3. Create the Script File:

Use `nano` or another text editor in Git Bash to create and edit the `create_certificate_authority.sh` script file:

nano create_certificate_authority.sh

4. Enter Script Content:

Paste the following script content for `create_certificate_authority.sh` into the text editor:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Simulating creation of Certificate Authority..."
sleep 1
echo "Certificate Authority created and saved to ca_cert.crt"

5. Save and Exit:

Save the file in `nano` by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then exit with `Ctrl + X`.

6. Make Script Executable:

Change the script file's permissions to make it executable:

chmod +x create_certificate_authority.sh

7. Run the Script:

Execute the script to simulate creating a Certificate Authority:

./create_certificate_authority.sh

Sample Output:

Below is the expected output when running `create_certificate_authority.sh`:

Simulating creation of Certificate Authority...
Certificate Authority created and saved to ca_cert.crt

This output confirms the successful execution of the script and indicates that the Certificate Authority (`ca_cert.crt`) has been simulated and saved.

Output Attachment:

The output from `create_certificate_authority.sh` has been included in the README.md file for reference.

Script Summary:

These steps guide us through creating and testing the create_certificate_authority.sh script file. This script provides a basic simulation of creating a Certificate Authority, offering essential feedback on the process.
