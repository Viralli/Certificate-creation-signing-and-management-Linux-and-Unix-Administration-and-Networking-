Explanation of `create_certificate_authority.sh` Script

    The create_certificate_authority.sh script shown below simulates the process of creating a Certificate Authority (CA) and generating a CA certificate in a Unix/Linux environment:

    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Simulating creation of Certificate Authority..."
    sleep 1
    echo "Certificate Authority created and saved to ca_cert.crt"

    1. Shebang (#!/bin/bash):

    The `#!/bin/bash` line at the beginning of the script is called a shebang. It specifies that the script should be interpreted and executed using the Bash shell (`/bin/bash`).

    2. Initial Message (`echo "Simulating creation of Certificate Authority..."`):

    This `echo` command prints the message "Simulating creation of Certificate Authority..." to the terminal. It informs the user that the script is starting the simulation of creating a Certificate Authority.

    3. Simulation Pause (`sleep 1`):

    The `sleep 1` command pauses the execution of the script for 1 second. This is a simulated delay, typically used to mimic the time it might take to perform a specific action. In this case, it simulates the process of creating a Certificate Authority.

    4. Completion Message (`echo "Certificate Authority created and saved to ca_cert.crt"`):

    After the sleep command completes, this `echo` command prints the message "Certificate Authority created and saved to ca_cert.crt". It indicates that the script has finished simulating the creation of the Certificate Authority and that the resulting 
    CA certificate (`ca_cert.crt`) has been generated and saved.
