Step-by-Step Guide for create_rsa_key.sh:

Description:
The `create_rsa_key.sh script` is designed to simulate the creation of an RSA private key in a Unix/Linux environment. It showcases basic shell scripting techniques and can be adapted for specific use cases requiring RSA 
key generation.


1. Open Git Bash:
Start by launching Git Bash. We can typically find it in the list of installed programs or applications.

2. Create a New Directory (Optional):
If we don't have a specific directory yet, we can create one to organize our `scripts`. For example, to create a new directory named scripts, we would use:

mkdir scripts

Then, navigate into this directory using:
cd scripts

3. Create the Script File:
Now, create the `create_rsa_key.sh script` file. We can create and edit the script file using the `nano` text editor:
nano create_rsa_key.sh

This command opens the `nano` editor in Git Bash specifically for creating/editing the `create_rsa_key.sh` file.

4. Enter Script Content:
In the nano editor, paste the following script content:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Simulating RSA private key creation..."
sleep 1
echo "RSA private key created and saved to rsa_private.key"

This script simulates the creation of an RSA private key and saves it to a file named `rsa_private.key`.

5. Save and Exit:

To save the changes made in `nano`, press `Ctrl + O` (for Write Out).
Confirm the file name (`create_rsa_key.sh`) and press `Enter`.
Then, press `Ctrl + X` to exit `nano`.

6. Make the Script Executable:

Before you can run the script, we need to make it executable. Navigate back to the Git Bash prompt if you're not already there and change the permissions of the script:
chmod +x create_rsa_key.sh

7. Run the Script:

Finally, execute the script using:
./create_rsa_key.sh

This command runs the script and should display the simulated output messages indicating the creation of the RSA private key.

Sample Output:
I have included the output of running `create_rsa_key.sh` below. This script simulates the creation of an RSA private key and saves it to `rsa_private.key`.

Simulating RSA private key creation...
RSA private key created and saved to rsa_private.key

This output demonstrates the successful execution of the script and the expected result.

Output Attachment:
The output from create_rsa_key.sh has been included in the README.md file for reference.

# Summary:
By following these steps, you can create, edit, make executable, and run the create_rsa_key.sh script directly within Git Bash on your local machine.
