Step-by-Step Guide for setup_apache_ssl.sh

Script Introduction:

The `setup_apache_ssl.sh` script is designed to simulate the setup of SSL for Apache in a Unix/Linux environment. It demonstrates fundamental shell scripting techniques and provides a straightforward approach to setting up SSL, serving as a foundation for handling 
SSL/TLS configuration tasks for web servers.

Steps to Create and Execute `setup_apache_ssl.sh`

1. Open Git Bash: Launch Git Bash on your computer.

2. Navigate to the Directory (Optional):

If you don't have a specific directory yet, we can create one to organize our scripts. For example, to create a new directory named `scripts`, use:

mkdir scripts

Then, navigate into this directory using:

cd scripts

3. Create the Script File: Use `nano` or another text editor in Git Bash to create and edit the `setup_apache_ssl.sh` script file:

nano setup_apache_ssl.sh

4. Enter Script Content: Paste the script content for `setup_apache_ssl.sh`:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Simulating Apache SSL setup..."
sleep 1
echo "Apache SSL setup completed"

5. Save and Exit: Save the file in `nano` by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then exit with `Ctrl + X`.

6. Make Script Executable: Change the script file's permissions to make it executable:

chmod +x setup_apache_ssl.sh

7. Run the Script: Execute the script to simulate setting up SSL for Apache:

./setup_apache_ssl.sh

Sample Output:

Running the setup_apache_ssl.sh script produces the following output:

Simulating Apache SSL setup...
Apache SSL setup completed

This output demonstrates the successful execution of the script and the expected result.

Output Attachment:

The output from setup_apache_ssl.sh has been included in the README.md file for reference.

Script Summary:

These steps will help us create and test the setup_apache_ssl.sh script file. Just like with the create_cert_request.sh script, this script simulates the setup of SSL for Apache and provides feedback on the process.
