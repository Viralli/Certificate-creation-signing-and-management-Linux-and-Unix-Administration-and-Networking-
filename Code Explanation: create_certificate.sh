Explanation of `create_certificate.sh` Script

The `create_certificate.sh` script shown below simulates the process of creating a certificate in a Unix/Linux environment:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Simulating creation of certificate..."
sleep 1
echo "Certificate created and saved to server_cert.crt"

Code Explanation:

1. `#!/bin/bash`

This line, known as a shebang, specifies that the script should be interpreted and executed using the Bash shell.

2. Initial Message:

echo "Simulating creation of certificate..."

The `echo` command prints the message "Simulating creation of certificate..." to the terminal. This line indicates the start of the simulation for creating a certificate.

3. Pause Execution:

sleep 1

The `sleep` command pauses the script's execution for 1 second. This simulates a brief delay, as might occur during the creation process.

4. Completion Message:

echo "Certificate created and saved to server_cert.crt"

This is another echo command that confirms the successful creation of the certificate. It notifies the user that the certificate has been generated and saved to a file named `server_cert.crt`.
