Explanation of `create_rsa_key.sh` Script

    The `create_rsa_key.sh` script shown below demonstrates the process of generating an RSA private key in a Unix/Linux environment:

    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Simulating RSA private key creation..."
    sleep 1
    echo "RSA private key created and saved to rsa_private.key"

    Code Explanation:

    #!/bin/bash
    `#!/bin/bash`: This command tells the computer to use the Bash shell to run the script.

    echo "Simulating RSA private key creation..."
    `echo "Simulating RSA private key creation..."`: The `echo` command prints the specified text ("Simulating RSA private key creation...") to the terminal. This line indicates that the script is starting the simulation of RSA private key creation.

    sleep 1
    `sleep 1`: The `sleep` command pauses the execution of the script for 1 second. This command imitates the time it might take to generate an RSA private key.

    echo "RSA private key created and saved to rsa_private.key"
    `echo "RSA private key created and saved to rsa_private.key"`: This is another echo command that confirms the successful creation of the RSA private key. It informs the user that the key has been generated and saved to a file named rsa_private.key.
