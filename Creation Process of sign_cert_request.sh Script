Step-by-Step Guide for `sign_cert_request.sh`

Script Introduction

The `sign_cert_request.sh` script is designed to simulate the signing of a certificate request in a Unix/Linux environment. It showcases basic shell scripting techniques and is useful for simulating the process of signing 
certificate requests (*.csr files). This script provides a straightforward approach to signing certificate requests and serves as a foundation for handling SSL/TLS certificate management tasks.

Steps to Create and Execute `sign_cert_request.sh`

1. Open Git Bash: Launch Git Bash on your computer.

2. Navigate to the Directory (Optional):

If you don't have a specific directory yet, you can create one to organize your scripts. For example, to create a new directory named `scripts`, use:

mkdir scripts

Then, navigate into this directory using:

cd scripts

3. Create the Script File: Use `nano` or another text editor in Git Bash to create and edit the `sign_cert_request.sh` script file:

nano sign_cert_request.sh

4. Enter Script Content: Paste the script content for `sign_cert_request.sh`:

#!/bin/bash
echo "Simulating signing of CSR..."
sleep 1
echo "CSR signed and saved to signed_cert.crt"

5. Save and Exit: Save the file in `nano` by pressing `Ctrl + O`, then exit with `Ctrl + X`.

6. Make Script Executable: Change the script file's permissions to make it executable:

chmod +x sign_cert_request.sh

7. Run the Script: Execute the script to simulate signing a certificate request:

./sign_cert_request.sh

Sample Output

I have included the output of running `sign_cert_request.sh` below. This script simulates the signing of a certificate request and saves it to `signed_cert.crt`.

Simulating signing of CSR...
CSR signed and saved to signed_cert.crt

This output demonstrates the successful execution of the script and the expected result.

Output Attachment

The output from `sign_cert_request.sh` has been included in the README.md file for reference.

Script Summary

These steps will help us create and test the `sign_cert_request.sh` script file. Just like with the `create_rsa_key.sh` and `create_cert_request.sh` scripts, this script simulates the signing of a certificate request and
provides feedback on the process.
